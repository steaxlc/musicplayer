Hi, This is a project developed by Luciano Castro

This was my first project that i built while i was learning React, only has been used React and Sass to the construction of this.

I learned how to use components and separate differents structures of the website to make the maintenance and changes easier, how to apply a customization depending the status of an object, how to work with audio.
